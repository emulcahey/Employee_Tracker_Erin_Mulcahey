# Employee_Tracker_Erin_Mulcahey

## Description

Employee Tracker is a command-line application to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and PostgreSQL. My motivation for creating this application was to make a way for an employer or company to keep track of information regarding their employees. With simple command line entries, the user can esily edit employee information. This application solves the problem of companies needing to figure out how to track, add, change, and delete employee inforamtion. The information that can be edited or tracked includes role, department, manager, salary, title, first name, and last name. I learned how to use Postgres, Selquelize, and how to use models to help create tables in pgAdmin.
